intro = """Groundwater is the water present beneath the ground surface. In the canton of Basel, groundwater circulates in shallow gravels of the Rhine valley (Rheinschotter). Groundwater is used for various purposes such as drinking, irrigation, heating and cooling. Despite the superior natural protection of groundwater compared to surface water, groundwater remains vulnerable to pollution, especially in the shallow and unconfined state and in densely populated areas. Groundwater, therefore, needs to be protected and monitored.

The Office of Environmental Protection of Basel (AUE) maintains a groundwater monitoring network currently comprising {}  wells ([more](https://www.aue.bs.ch/wasser/grundwasser.html)). These wells have been monitored since 1993 for water quantity (level) and quality (chemical and physical parameters). This extensive dataset is published on the [Open Government Data Portal](https://data.bs.ch/explore/dataset/100067), ready for further analysis. The app *Groundwater.bs* attempts to illustrate the value of this rich dataset by highlighting particular aspects. The analyses are organized in short articles, each article comprising an explanatory text and as well as a data playground, where the reader may conduct additional graphical and numerical analysis. 

The first article is dedicated to the study of groundwater temperature. Select the *Temperature* menu item in the sidebar menu to start your groundwater journey. If you have comments regarding the findings or suggestions for further studies, please contact the author or leave a comment in the [OGD Dataset comments sections](https://data.bs.ch/explore/dataset/100067/comments/).
