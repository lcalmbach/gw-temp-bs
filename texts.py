intro = """Groundwater is the water present beneath the ground surface and is an important source for both drinking and irrigation. In the canton of Basel, groundwater circulates in shallow gravels of the Rhine valley (Rheinschotter). In spite of its superior protection of groundwater as compared to surface water, groundwater is still vulnerable to pollution especially in the shallow and unconfied state and beneath a densely populated area. It therefore needs to be protected and monitored.

The Office of Environmental Protection of Basel (AUE) maintains a groundwater monitoring network currently comprising {}  wells ([more](https://www.aue.bs.ch/wasser/grundwasser.html)). These wells are monitored since 1993 for water quantity (level) and quality (chemical and physical parameters). This extensive dataset is  published on the [Open Government Data Portal](https://data.bs.ch/explore/dataset/100067) ready for further analysis. The app *Groundwater.bs* attemps to illustrate the value of  this dataset by highlighting particular aspects. The analyses are organized in short articles, each article comprising a explainatory text and as well as a data playground, where the reader may conduct additional graphical an numerical analysis. 

A first articale is dedicated to the study of groundwater temperature. Select the *Temperature* menu item in the sidebar-menu to start your groundwater-journey. If you have comments regarding the findings or suggestions for further studies, please contact the author or leave a comment in the [OGD Dataset comments sections](https://data.bs.ch/explore/dataset/100067/comments/).
