intro = """### About groundwater.bs
In the canton of Basel, groundwater circulates in shallow gravels of the Rhine valley (Rheinschotter). The local groundwater is used for various purposes, such as drinking, irrigation, heating, and cooling. Despite the superior natural protection of groundwater compared to surface water, groundwater remains vulnerable to pollution, especially in a shallow and unconfined state and in densely populated areas. Groundwater, therefore, needs to be protected and monitored.

The Office of Environmental Protection of Basel (AUE) maintains a groundwater monitoring network comprising {} wells monitored for groundwater quality and {} wells monitored for water levels ([more](https://www.aue.bs.ch/wasser/grundwasser.html)). The AUE also provides the inventory of all boreholes in the canton area. This rich dataset is published on the [Open Government Data Portal](https://data.bs.ch/explore/dataset/100067), ready for further analysis. *groundwater.bs* attempts to facilitate access and use of this data by providing customized graphical user interfaces for exploring the various datasets. Various related environmental datasets such as climate data or rhine River data are included in this app and can be compared to the groundwater monitoring data.
