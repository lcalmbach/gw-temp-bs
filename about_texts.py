intro = """### About groundwater.bs
In the canton of Basel, groundwater circulates in shallow gravels of the Rhine valley (Rheinschotter). The local groundwater is used for various purposes such as drinking, irrigation, heating, and cooling. Despite the superior natural protection of groundwater compared to surface water, groundwater remains vulnerable to pollution, especially in the shallow and unconfined state and in densely populated areas. Groundwater, therefore, needs to be protected and monitored.

The Office of Environmental Protection of Basel (AUE) maintains a groundwater monitoring network comprising {} wells monitored for groundwater quality and {} wells monitored for water levels ([more](https://www.aue.bs.ch/wasser/grundwasser.html)). The AUE also provides the inventory of all boreholes in the canton area. This rich dataset is published on the [Open Government Data Portal](https://data.bs.ch/explore/dataset/100067), ready for further analysis. *groundwater.bs* attempts to facilitate access and use of this data by providing customized graphical user interfaces for exploring the various datasets. Various related environmental datasets such as climate data or rhine River data are included in this app and can be compared to the groundwater monitoring data. 

The menu's first three options: *borehole records, water level monitoring, and water quality monitoring* allow exploring the beforementioned datasets. The additional options represent interactive articles, each highlighting a different aspect of the groundwater of Basel. The first article is dedicated to the study of groundwater temperature. Further reports will follow in the future. 

If you have comments regarding this app, the data presented, or suggestions for further studies, don't hesitate to contact the author or leave a comment in the [OGD Dataset comments sections](https://data.bs.ch/explore/dataset/100067/comments/).
