    "info": """## Water quality monitoring
The Kanton of Basel operates a groundwater quality monitoring network including {0} wells. {1} of these wells were monitored in the past 5 years. The measurements include {2} different chemical and physical observation parameters.Guideline values have been added to the dataset to easily detect exceedances (values extracted from 814.201 Waters Protection Ordinance (WPO)). Note that the values given are defined for surface water. However, article 22 states that the quality of the groundwater must be such that it does not pollute surface water after exfiltration. Therefore the same surface water limits are also applied to groundwater. 

### Menu options
**Stations/samples**: The menu option gives you access to drill down from station records to the samples for each station and finally to the details for each sample. 

**Parameters**: This menu option allows to select a parameter and view all or filtered results of its measurement. If the results are filtered by station, the observations can also be viewed as a time series plots. Where available, the guideline value can be shown as a horizontal line on the plot.
